### User Interaction

Consider the following when communicating with the staff.

- The staff is a single person who is very technical. Explanations should be very detailed and technical in nature.
- Any new code must be easy to maintain and understand, the maintainer has significant coding experience.

## Program architecture

- Do not make additional apps or services.
- Do not make command line tools.
- Do not create a long single file application. Always use an easy-to-understand directory structure.
- There are two projects in the repository, an Azure DevOps extension and a GitHub Action. Do not make changes to both projects in a single pull request.
- Both projects are written in TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
- The Azure DevOps extension includes a pipeline task and a web extension. The pipeline task is written in TypeScript and the web extension is written in HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.
- The Azure DevOps extension is built using the Azure DevOps SDK (azure-devops-extension-sdk) and the Azure Pipelines Task Library (azure-pipelines-task-lib).
- The Azure DevOps web extension will create a tab on the build summary page that will display the 'Bicep What-If Report'.
- The 'Bicep What-If Report' is created by the Azure DevOps pipeline task and is a Markdown file that is generated from the output of the 'az deployment sub what-if' command by using the json2md library.
- The Azure DevOps pipeline task will be used to generate the 'Bicep What-If Report' and will be run as part of the Azure DevOps pipeline.
- The Azure DevOps pipeline task will accept a parameter that is a file path to the JSON output of the 'az deployment sub what-if' command created in a previous step and will generate a Markdown file that is the 'Bicep What-If Report'.
- Currently the GitHub Action project has not started development, but it will be a GitHub Action that uses TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
- Only use HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. No other languages.
- TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript, so all JavaScript files should be ignored since they are generated by the TypeScript compiler.
- Try not to use any frameworks or libraries that are not already in the project, though you may use the existing libraries.
- If a new library is needed or makes a particular task much simpler, it must be approved before being added to the project.
- Any changes need to be documented in the README.md file at the root of the project.
