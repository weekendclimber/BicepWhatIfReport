/**
 * Inline AMD loader implementation.
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * This loader provides basic AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) support for loading
 * and defining modules in the absence of a full-featured AMD library like RequireJS.
 * It is specifically designed to support `SDK.min.js` and other simple module use cases.
 * 
 * Limitations:
 * - Does not support advanced dependency resolution or module caching.
 * - Limited to resolving `exports` and other basic dependencies.
 * - Not suitable for complex module loading scenarios.
 * 
 * Differences from RequireJS:
 * - Minimalistic implementation with no support for asynchronous loading.
 * - No support for configuration, plugins, or advanced dependency management.
 * 
 * Supported Dependency Patterns:
 * - `exports`: Allows modules to export functionality.
 * - Other dependencies are resolved as empty objects (custom resolution can be added).
 * 
 * Known Limitations:
 * - Modules are not cached, so the same module may be re-evaluated multiple times.
 * - Only supports synchronous module definitions.
